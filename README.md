# CSV Migration Tool

## Description

This tool is to migrate data from a CSV to another CSV with similar-but-different columns.

The tool will attempt to merge all columns with the same name between the two documents while maintaining the layout of the new CSV file to which data is migrating to prevent issues importing the document into other tools.
